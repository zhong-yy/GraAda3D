# How the sensitivity matrix is store, and how the conjugate gradient method is implemented
# 0: store a full sensitivity matrix, and use the lscg implementation of Eigen 3 library (lscg: least square conjugate gradient method) 
# 1: store a full sensitivity matrix, and use my own implementation of the lscg method
# 2: use the wavelet transform to compress the sensitivity matrix, and use my own implementation of the lscg method

# If the above option is 2 (using wavelet transform), the following relative threshold should be defined
# A larger threshold results in larger compression ratio, and larger approximation error as well

#Lp norm for the regularization terms: p_s, p_z, p_x, p_y, p_t, epsilon2
#--"p": means Lp norm will be used
#--"epsilon2" :a small value is used to avoid singularity
#For L1-norm inversion (p=1), the inversion result is more focusing with smaller epsilon2, while larger value of epsilon2 produce smoother inversion results.
#The first 5 parameters specify the norms of different regularization terms: |m|, |Wz*m|, |Wx*m|, |Wy*m| and cross-gradient term
#For example, 2 1 1 1 2 1e-9 means L2 norm is used for ||m2||, L1 norm is used for ||Wx*m||, ||Wy*m||, ||Wz*m|| and 1e-9 is used to avoid sigularity
