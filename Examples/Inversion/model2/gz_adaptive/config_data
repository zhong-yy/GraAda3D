#In the code, the total error is assumed as (relative error*data+absolute error) which is used to construct the data weighting diagonal matrix Wd.
#The weight of each data is 1/(relative error*abs(data)+absolute error).
#Note that when the gravity/ggt anomalies are near 0 at some observation points and absolute error is set to 0, 1/(relative error*abs(data)) may become very large. 
#In this case, a reasonable absolute error is required to guarantee robustness.
#For example, 0.02 1e-4 mean that the relative error is assumed as 2%, and the absolute error(e.g. instrumental/methodological precision) is 1e-4 
0.02 1e-3
