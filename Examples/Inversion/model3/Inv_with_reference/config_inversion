# How the sensitivity matrix is store, and how the conjugate gradient method is implemented
# 0: store a full sensitivity matrix, and use the lscg implementation of Eigen 3 library (not recommended) (lscg: least square conjugate gradient method) 
# 1: store a full sensitivity matrix, and use my own implementation of the lscg method
# 2: use the wavelet transform to compress the sensitivity matrix, and use my own implementation of the lscg method

# If the above option is 2 (using wavelet transform), the following relative threshold should be defined
# A larger threshold results in larger compression ratio, and larger approximation error as well

#Lp norm parameters: p (the first 5 parameters), epsilon2 (the last parameter)
#For L1-norm inversion (p=1), the inversion result is more focusing with smaller epsilon2, while larger value of epsilon2 produce smoother inversion results.
#--"p": means Lp norm will be used. 
#--"epsilon2" (the last number in this row) :a small value is used to avoid singularity
# The first 5 parameters indicate norms of different regularization terms: |m|, |Dz*m|, |Dx*m|, |Dy*m| and cross-gradient term

#Reference density model. Users must obtain a reference density model in advance.
#---(1) The first string is the file with gridded data of a reference model.
#---(2) The second parameter should be combination of characters 'x', 'y' and  'z', specifying how the coordinates are ordered in the file.
#       For example "yxz" means: y(column 1) x(column 2) z(column 3) value(column 4)
#---(3) The next 3 parameters: n1 n2 n3 are the number of grid nodes along each dimension, in a order corresponding to the previous parameter (such as "yxz").
#---(4) The final parameter is the index order which determins which axis index changes faster and which one changes slower. 
#       It is also a combination of "xyz". For example, "zxy" means the z index changes fastest, while y index changes slower and z index changes the slowest
