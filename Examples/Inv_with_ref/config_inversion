#--"p": means Lp norm will be used

#For L1-norm inversion (p=1), the inversion result is more focusing with smaller epsilon2, while larger value of epsilon2 produce smoother inversion results.

#Reference density model. Users must obtain a reference density model in advance.
#---(1) The first string is the file with gridded data of a reference model.
#---(2) The second parameter should be combination of characters 'x', 'y' and  'z', specifying how the coordinates are ordered in the file.
#       For example "yxz" means: y(column 1) x(column 2) z(column 3) value(column 4)
#---(3) The next 3 numbers: n1 n2 n3, specifying the number of grid nodes along each dimension, in a order described by the preceding parameter (such as "yxz").
#---(4) The final number should be 0 or 1. It indicates which dimension (x or y) changes fastest. 0 represents x, 1 represents y. Whatever fast_dimension is,
#       the z dimension is assumed to be changing slowest.
